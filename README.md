### Unit Testing

Inside of this cookbook we are testing with [Chefpsec](https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec) to verify that our resources are being called in the way we want them to be called


### Integration Tests

There are several different ways to run integration tests.  The first style is serverspec on test-kitchen, this approach was the defacto standard for running integration tests but the new awesome sauce is using chef audit mode so each chef run actually runs tests which is what this repo uses
